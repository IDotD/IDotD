# Features

- A chat system, that allows raid sharing to specific groups of people in private rooms and auto-pubbing those raids
- An automatic raid-join service avaible on facebook, armorgames and kongregate(Attention, the facebook version needs iframes for that)
- You can see the basic ingame data of people chatting on Kong while on the Dawn of the Dragon's Game-Page
- You help adding to known Kongregate names, improving the Search and increasing the amount of people that will show you their ingame Profile
- Provide a list of unjoined raids, where you can copy the links with a single click(ALL platforms)
- A Helper for war-events being run by 5PG
