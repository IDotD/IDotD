We support Opera, Firefox and Chrome. Please make sure to update your installation of those on a regular basis, since we can't guarantee, that the script will work on outdated versions.

## What is it?

IDotD combines a raid catcher, a way of automatically joining desired raids, with a few other tools like chatrooms with raid-sharing options within those specific rooms, looking up tiers and calculation what piece of land to buy next.

Additionally there are a few platform specific features, for example quick information about players in the kongregate chat rooms or a timeable autojoin for newgrounds to replace the usual ones on other platforms.

Most information is avaible at [this project's wiki](https://idotd.github.io/).

## Bugs, desired Features etc.

We prefer the usage of the [tracker](https://github.com/IDotD/Userscript/issues) here, otherwise we do import requests from [GoogleDocs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ozOWQuAEKCNnt2cwQ4SZtkpYM_pvrl8Bnj0e_O1KKWs/edit) from time to time.

## How To Help

We can use helpers for the following: update and improve the wiki, help coding the userscript and testing any of the branches. For any of the later two have a look at the related documentation in the wiki.
